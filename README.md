How to setup and use the new Unity input system

## Setting up the project

First switch on the new input system in the `Project Settings`. Go to the `Edit` menu, and choose `Project Settings`. Then click on the `Player` category and find the `Active Input Handling` entry in the `Configuration` section. Now click on the `Input System Package (New)` option.

After you have done this, a dialog box will pop up:

Click `Apply` and then your project will close itself and open again.

Before you can start using the new input system, you need to import the package. You can do this by opening the package manager, clicking on the `Packages: In Project` button, and choosing `Unity Registry`:

Now, if you type `Input` into the search box, it should find the `Input System` package which you can install by clicking on the `Install` button.
